## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Liquor Shop Management System. The goal is to ensure the system is robust, reliable, and functions correctly across all components and user roles. This strategy encompasses various testing approaches and provides guidelines for implementing effective test suites.

## Testing Approach

The Liquor Shop Management System will be tested using a multi-layered approach:

1. **Unit Testing**: Focus on testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between related components
3. **Functional Testing**: Verify system behavior against requirements
4. **API Testing**: Ensure API endpoints work as expected
5. **Performance Testing**: Validate system performance under various loads
6. **Security Testing**: Check for security vulnerabilities

The testing strategy follows these principles:

- **Shift Left**: Testing begins as early as possible in the development process
- **Automation First**: Automate wherever possible to ensure reproducibility
- **Risk-Based**: Focus more testing effort on critical system components
- **User-Centric**: Test flows reflect actual user journeys and scenarios

## Test Environment

## Test Coverage Requirements

For code quality and reliability, the system should maintain the following test coverage:

- **Core Business Logic**: 90%+ coverage
- **API Endpoints**: 100% coverage
- **Models**: 90%+ coverage
- **Serializers/Forms**: 90%+ coverage
- **Utility Functions**: 85%+ coverage
- **Admin Interfaces**: 70%+ coverage

Overall code coverage target: 85%+

Critical components that must have comprehensive test coverage:

1. Authentication and authorization
2. Financial calculations
3. Inventory management
4. Sales processing
5. Reporting functionality
6. Multi-tenancy isolation

## Test Organization

Tests should be organized according to the following structure:

```
backend/
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/                 # Unit tests
│   │   ├── test_models.py
│   │   ├── test_serializers.py
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── integration/          # Integration tests
│   │   ├── test_tenant_admin_api.py
│   │   ├── test_saas_admin_api.py
│   │   ├── test_inventory_sales_api.py
│   │   ├── test_reports_api.py
│   │   ├── test_executive_manager_api.py
│   │   └── ...
│   └── functional/           # Functional tests
│       ├── test_executive_workflows.py
│       ├── test_manager_workflows.py
│       ├── test_tenant_admin_workflows.py
│       └── ...
```

Each test file should:
- Focus on a specific component or related group of components
- Have clear and descriptive test method names
- Include docstrings explaining the purpose of each test
- Set up required test data in `setUp` methods or fixtures
- Clean up after tests when necessary

## Running Tests

### Running All Tests

```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Running Specific Test Categories

```bash
# Run only unit tests
python manage.py test tests.unit

# Run only integration tests
python manage.py test tests.integration

# Run only functional tests
python manage.py test tests.functional

# Run a specific test file
python manage.py test tests.integration.test_tenant_admin_api
```

### Test with Coverage

```bash
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
coverage html  # Generate HTML report
```

## Test Reporting

The system should generate comprehensive test reports including:

1. **Test Results**: Pass/fail status of all tests
2. **Coverage Reports**: Code coverage metrics
3. **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, etc.
4. **Security Issues**: Any identified security vulnerabilities

These reports should be:
- Generated automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- Stored historically for trend analysis
- Accessible to all team members
- Included in release documentation

## Continuous Integration

All tests should be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline. The following checks should be enforced:

1. All tests must pass before merging code
2. Code coverage must meet or exceed target thresholds
3. No security vulnerabilities should be introduced
4. Code quality metrics must be maintained
5. Performance tests should not show significant degradation

Integration with GitHub Actions or similar CI platform is recommended.

## Test Data Management

### Test Fixtures

- Use Django fixtures for base data
- For complex test scenarios, create data programmatically in setUp methods
- Use factory libraries (like factory_boy) for test data generation

### Test Data Isolation

- Each test should create and manage its own data
- Tests should not depend on data created by other tests
- Use database transactions to isolate test data

### Sensitive Data

- Never use real customer or production data in tests
- Generate synthetic data that mimics production characteristics
- Mask/obfuscate any sensitive information

## User Role-Specific Test Scenarios

The system should include comprehensive test scenarios for each user role:

### SaaS Admin Tests

- Tenant management (creation, configuration, deactivation)
- Platform team management
- System settings and configuration
- Email template management
- System monitoring and health checks

### Tenant Admin Tests

- Shop management
- Team management
- Brand management
- Supplier management
- Reports and analytics
- Financial oversight

### Manager Tests

- Inventory management
- Sales approval workflows
- Cash management
- Staff oversight
- Daily operations reporting

### Executive Tests

- Daily login/logout
- Sales creation and processing
- Cash reconciliation
- Inventory checks

Each role should be tested with both valid and invalid operations to ensure proper authorization controls.

## End-to-End Test Workflows

The following end-to-end workflows should be tested:

1. **Executive Daily Workflow**
   - Login as executive
   - Record daily login with opening cash
   - Create multiple sales
   - Process returns if applicable
   - Record daily logout with cash reconciliation

2. **Manager Approval Workflow**
   - Login as manager
   - Review pending sales
   - Approve/reject sales
   - Review daily sales records
   - Approve/reject daily sales records
   - Record bank deposits

3. **Inventory Management Workflow**
   - Create brands and stock
   - Process stock adjustments
   - Request and approve stock transfers
   - Generate inventory reports

4. **Reporting Workflow**
   - Generate various report types
   - Schedule automated reports
   - View and export reports
   - Analyze sales and inventory data

5. **User Management Workflow**
   - Create users with different roles
   - Assign shops to users
   - Deactivate and reactivate users
   - Reset user passwords

These workflows should be tested both individually and as part of larger system tests.

## API Testing Strategy

All API endpoints should be tested for:

1. **Authentication**
   - Unauthenticated access should be rejected
   - Expired tokens should be rejected
   - Invalid tokens should be rejected

2. **Authorization**
   - Users should only access resources they are authorized for
   - Role-based permissions should be enforced

3. **Input Validation**
   - Valid inputs should be processed correctly
   - Invalid inputs should return appropriate error messages
   - Malformed requests should be handled gracefully

4. **Response Format**
   - JSON structure should match API specification
   - All required fields should be present
   - Data types should be correct

5. **Status Codes**
   - Successful operations should return appropriate 2xx codes
   - Client errors should return appropriate 4xx codes
   - Server errors should return appropriate 5xx codes

6. **Error Handling**
   - Clear error messages should be provided
   - Sensitive information should not be leaked in errors
   - System should remain stable after errors

## Conclusion

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the Liquor Shop Management System. By implementing these testing strategies, we can be confident that the system will meet its requirements and provide a robust solution for managing liquor shop operations across all user roles and functionality areas.
